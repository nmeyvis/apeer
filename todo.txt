how does setting the torrent on the file after adding to local files, update the peers?

todo:

remove file from torrent client on remove from filelist (filelist removeFile shouldn't be accessing the torrentClient)
you may need to call URL.revokeObjectURL() when files are removed
copy/paste invite link from input field doesnt work on mobile
back button (at least on mobile) should close any embedded windows, possibly routing with tabs too
pressing esc on desktop should close the preview window
previewing a file, closing it, then previewing another file, flashes the previous file before showing the desired one
understand how reconnecting to sockets affects the state of the client app
connection info user feedback (ie, notify user about connection issues)
	allow transfers through the server as backup
cannot open join room while room settings is open on mobile
